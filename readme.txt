Motivision helps to keep your team motivated every day. It shows global and particular statistics about how much every user is writing.

== Description ==

This plugin was planned when I was working with my writer team on my sports journal project. It was a non-profit project, so the writers needed extra motivation in order to write new articles every day and week to keep the project alive.

Motivision Plugin helped to show how much every contributor was working and what the project goals were. It was really exciting to see the contributors writing and then watching how much the Motivision Plugin progress bar increased every day.

My non-profit online sport journal has been the most read journal in the city for the last 5 years and it even won an award from a very important journal in the province thanks to the Motivision Plugin.
